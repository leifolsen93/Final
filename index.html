			<p class="fs-3 p-5 m-5 bg-warning">Well it's always nice to see another semester come and go.  Good or bad, I'm happy I stuck it out.  I thought it was a very interesting class and topic.  Web Development was really fun to dip my toes into.  Learning how some of the websites I use everyday operate was a great experience.  I always knew how to inpect web pages, but I never really knew what I was looking at.  It's a little confidence boost to understand some of whats going on under the hood.  I wouldn't say I have a career in design, but I had fun learning.  As of right now, I can't wait till I start going back to in person classes.  I have certainly had a harder time doing online only.  It's made everything harder especially studying.  I'm ready to hit restart and keep moving forward this fall.</p>
